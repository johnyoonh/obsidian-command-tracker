# Command Tracker

An [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) plugin that tracks the number of times the command is used.

This plugin helps optimize the plugins and hotkeys used.  
You can check the date of last use of each command and how much times each command is used daily.

- If you find a command you use frequently from the command palette, you may want to assign a hotkey to it.
- If a hotkey which a command assigned is rarely used, you may want to consider ceding the hotkey to another command (or uninstall the target plugin).
